additionsToViewerCategories	"Answer a list of (<categoryName> <list of category specs>) pairs that characterize the	phrases this kind of morph wishes to add to various Viewer categories.	This version factors each category definition into a separate method.	Subclasses that have additions can either:		- override this method, or		- (preferably) define one or more additionToViewerCategory* methods.	The advantage of the latter technique is that class extensions may be added	by external packages without having to re-define additionsToViewerCategories.	"	^#()
