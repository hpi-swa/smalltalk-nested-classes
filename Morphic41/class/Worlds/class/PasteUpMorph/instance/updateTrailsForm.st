If the list from the previous display cycle isn't empty, then trails are drawn from the old to the new positions of those morphs on the turtle-trails form. The turtle-trails form is created on demand when the first pen is put down and removed (to save space) when turtle trails are cleared."	| removals |	self flag: #bob.
